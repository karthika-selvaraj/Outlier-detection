# Outlier Detection
- Outliers are something which looks very odd from other data points. If we did not handle them, then it will affect the performance of model.
- This repository will describes about removing outliers using the statistics concept 'Standard deviation' and 'z-score'. 
- Standard deviation will measure the dispersion of data points by computing distance of data to its mean.
- Z-score will say how may standard deviation away a data point is.
